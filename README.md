To begin, I first chose a pair of languages to refactor in.
I chose PHP and R, since I had NetBeans (which allegedly supports PHP out of the box) and RStudio already installed.
I have never used PHP, but I had used R briefly in my probability theory course in Fall 2018, but we mostly used it as a calculator and to analyze data.
I got the R code working in no time, had no issues with it at all. 
However, getting the PHP stuff working was a nightmare, and I eventually gave up on it.
Then I decided to choose a different language,  C++.
I installed Eclipse's C/C++ package and tried to open the project to no avail.
I also gave up on C++.
So, I think I'll just do it in R twice, even though I have a strong suspicion I'll never use it again after this project.
I'm going to email Yemi and see if he can help me out.
